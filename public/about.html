<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I’m Huajian Chen, a recent Computer Science graduate with a passion for software development and a drive to solve real-world problems through technology. With strong proficiencies in Java, Swift, and Python, I’ve built a solid foundation in both web and mobile development. My experience spans a variety of frameworks and tools, including Spring, React, and Android Jetpack, allowing me to create dynamic and user-centered applications.</p>

<p>I thrive on learning new technologies and continuously challenging myself to build solutions that are efficient, scalable, and user-friendly. Some of my recent projects include:</p>

<br>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Mini Spotify:</strong> A Kotlin-based music app featuring a smart UI, offline playback, and an efficient API interaction model using Retrofit.</li>
 <br>
  <li><strong>Next AI:</strong>A React and Node.js platform that integrates with OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 Turbo API, designed to facilitate PDF document inquiries with real-time AI-driven interactions.</li>
<br>
  <li><strong>Around:</strong> A social network built with React and Go, hosted on Google Cloud, with enhanced search capabilities through Elasticsearch.</li>
<br>
  <li><strong>Online Order:</strong> A Spring and React-based application for managing online orders, featuring robust security and scalable deployment on AWS.</li>  
</ul>

<p>In addition to my technical projects, I gained hands-on experience as a Teaching Assistant at Northeastern Illinois University, where I provided individualized support, developed exam prep tools, and led workshops to guide over 40 students each semester through complex computer science concepts.</p>

<p>As a U.S. citizen based in Chicago, I’m actively seeking full-time opportunities in software development. I’m excited to contribute to projects that push the boundaries of technology and improve user experiences.
